# Tests Vectors
This repository aims to provide test vectors for polygon-hermez zkevm implementation

[![Check test-vectors](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-testvectors/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-testvectors/actions/workflows/main.yaml)

> **WARNING**: All code here is in WIP

Maintained tests:

```
/inputs-executor
/merkle-tree
/mt-bridge
/poseidon
/state-transition
```

## Ethereum test vectors coverage
- Ethereum test targeted are located [here](https://github.com/ethereum/tests/tree/develop/BlockchainTests/GeneralStateTests)
> `Ignored` test does not fit in zkEVM implementation. Therefore, it could not eb applied to zkEVM.
> More coverage will be added while test are being tested
